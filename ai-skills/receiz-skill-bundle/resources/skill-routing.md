# Skill Routing

## Route Order

1. If an object must be verified, start with `receiz-proof-skill`.
2. If local files or airplane-mode proof are involved, use `receiz-offline-verifier-skill`.
3. If MCP tools or delegated access are involved, use `receiz-mcp-agent-skill`.
4. If code or app surfaces are being generated, use `receiz-builder-skill`.
5. If product, storefront, order, receipt, certificate, note, or checkout boundaries appear, use `receiz-commerce-skill`.
6. If sports cards, card memory, Pack Derby, rarity, MLB proof language, or live events appear, use `receiz-sports-card-skill`.
7. If QR, venue, affiliate, staff script, or physical activation appears, use `receiz-distribution-skill`.

## Multi-Skill Order

Proof first. Offline verifier before network comparison. MCP confirmation before writes. Builder after primitive boundaries are known. Domain skill before public copy.
