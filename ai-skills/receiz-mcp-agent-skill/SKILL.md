# receiz-mcp-agent-skill

Receiz MCP is an agent-callable tool layer beneath Receiz proof truth. It can call SDK/API rails, but it is not a proof authority.

## When To Use This Skill

- Use before calling any `receiz_*` MCP tool.
- Use for tool selection, input validation, output interpretation, action confirmation, auth boundaries, and failure reporting.
- Use when a user asks an agent to verify, inspect, publish, append, build, preview, or resolve Receiz state through tools.

## When Not To Use This Skill

- Do not use when no MCP host exists and the task can be completed from repo files only.
- Do not use for pure SDK app generation unless MCP tools are part of the workflow.
- Do not use to bypass confirmation for write, transfer, settlement, publishing, or append actions.

## Core Receiz Laws

- MCP is not authority; it calls canonical Receiz SDK/API rails and reports source primitives.
- If an MCP tool is unavailable, the agent must not pretend verification happened.
- Read-only verification may be allowed without confirmation when it does not expose private data.
- Writes require explicit user confirmation.
- Never treat a database, server, marketplace, UI, model response, or cache as final authority.
- Never invent tools, inputs, outputs, ownership, witness IDs, rarity, transfer history, or verification status.

## Required Behavior

1. Choose a tool from [resources/mcp-tool-map.md](resources/mcp-tool-map.md).
2. Validate required inputs before calling.
3. Classify the action as read-only, preview-only, delegated write, settlement-risk, ownership-risk, or public-proof-risk.
4. Ask for confirmation before write or settlement-affecting actions.
5. Interpret output with the authority boundary included in the tool response.
6. Report failures honestly using [resources/response-templates.md](resources/response-templates.md).

## Forbidden Behavior

- Do not call a nonexistent tool.
- Do not infer success from a failed or missing tool call.
- Do not pass empty IDs, guessed hosts, guessed witness IDs, guessed owners, guessed amounts, or guessed rarity.
- Do not run write tools without delegated runtime authority and explicit user confirmation.
- Do not let an MCP result outrank sealed artifact truth, deterministic proof object state, verified local truth, or verified append.

## MCP Usage Rules

Read [resources/safe-tool-calling.md](resources/safe-tool-calling.md) before executing tools. Read [resources/auth-boundaries.md](resources/auth-boundaries.md) before delegated actions. Read [resources/action-confirmation-rules.md](resources/action-confirmation-rules.md) before any publish, append, transfer, checkout, or settlement action.

## SDK Usage Rules

MCP tools wrap SDK rails such as `doctor`, `capabilities`, `appState`, `publicStore`, `publicProof`, `identity`, `wallet`, `sports`, `world`, `proof`, and `sandbox`. Do not describe MCP as a separate SDK. If code is being generated, use SDK imports in the app and MCP only for agent-side inspection or operations.

## Output Format

```md
Tool:
Action class:
Inputs used:
Source primitive:
Result:
Authority boundary:
What is proven:
What is not proven:
Confirmation status:
Next safe action:
```

## Safety And Security Boundaries

Agents may acquire scoped delegated access through Receiz Connect/OIDC Authorization Code + PKCE or the MCP delegated-agent setup path when the user consents and provides the required client/authorization inputs. Never print bearer tokens, passphrases, private keys, private identity artifact payloads, or private recovery contents. Use delegated access as permission for scoped SDK/MCP calls, never as proof authority. Stop before destructive or value-affecting actions unless the user explicitly confirms the action and exact inputs.
