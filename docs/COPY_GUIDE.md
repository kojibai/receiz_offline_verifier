# Copy guide

Use these strings and framing rules for v13 verifier UX and release communications.

## Core product line
- "Verify an original."
- "Upload anything. Proof lives in the original."

## Capability summary
- "Supports PNG, PDF, trailer-sealed artifacts, .receizbundle containers, and package ZIP/folder scans."
- "Screenshots won’t verify. Ask for the original."

## Verification success
- "Verified original"
- "All required checks passed."

## Verification failure framing
- "Not verified"
- "Verification failed"
- "One or more required checks failed."

## Integrity language constraints
- Prefer "verified" / "not verified" over subjective trust wording.
- Always tie outcomes to byte-level checks and canonical fields.
- Do not imply verification if artifact binding or canonical invariants fail.
